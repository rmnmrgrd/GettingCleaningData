# Getting and Cleaning Data


## Goals of the project

The purpose of this project is to demonstrate my ability to collect, work with, and clean a data set. The goal is to prepare tidy data that can be used for later analysis.

## Steps to execute the script

Assuming that all data is stored in the `dataset` subfolder and follows the structure of the zip file provided by the instructions, the script `run_analysis.R` shall be executed. This script calculates two tidy datasets, `tidy_dataset` and `tidy_dataset_avg`, described in the codebook `codeBook.md`. The script also saves the contents of `tidy_dataset_avg` into a text file `output.txt`.
